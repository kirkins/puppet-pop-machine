** Scenario:

   Puppet pop machine company. Wants to develop several modules on
   an IoT in parallel. Also wants to deploy different software 
   variations on different hardware. Interested in the ability to
   A/B test features and layouts.  

** Puppet is f(x) = f(f(x))
   
   Puppet tries to be Idempotent.

   Idempotence:

     is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer 
     science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the 
     result beyond the initial application

   No matter how many times you run a configuration on a server the 
   end-state should remain the same.

** Puppet allows for custom facts

   We can add our own facts based on the state of the system

   For example:
   

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby

       require 'json'
       
       if !File.exist? '/home/pi/pop_machine/data/pops.json'
         exit
       end
       
       system_json = JSON.parse(File.read('/home/pi/pop_machine/data/pops.json'))
       
       Facter.add(:pops) do
         setcode do
           system_json['pops']
         end
       end

   #+END_SRC
   
   /Demo: goto www.p42k.win:8000/ 

** Puppt has built in diagnostics

   - disk space
   - cpu usage
   - hardware specs
     
   /Demo: diagnostics www.p42k.win/
** External node classifier

   Puppet uses an script called an ENC for classifying nodes.

   Nodes (pop machines) will be configured based on classification.

   The ENC script can be written in any language. As long as it takes
   a hostname for input and outputs yaml like:

       environment: production

** R10K - What is it
   
   A code management tool that uses a 'control-repo'
   
   - Each branch on the repo represents a single configuration.
   - When R10K is run it extracts each branch into its own folder. 

*** R10K file system

   /etc/puppetlabs/code
   |── Puppetfile
   |── local_modules
   |   |── custom_facts
   |   |── custom_files

** R10K - for QA
   
   Allows for mixing and matching modules:
   
   QA team can create it's own branches each with a variation
   in the packages installed.

       #+BEGIN_SRC puppet
  
       $latest_packages = [
         'pop_machine-gui',
       ]
       
       $specific_packages = [
         'vending_module=1.2',
         'apple_pay=2.5',
       ]

       #+END_SRC

** R10K - for development
   
   Allows for multiple teams to work on seperate branches
   and map them to beta machines. Easily mix and match modules.

** R10K - for release
   
    Potential for creating A/B tests for devices.
